                <h2>History of the Japan Self-Defense Forces</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="mission-statement">
                <h3>Constitutional Foundation</h3>
                <p>The JSDF was established within the framework of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces war as a sovereign right and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) represent Japan's modern military capabilities while adhering to its unique constitutional constraints. The evolution of the JSDF reflects Japan's changing security environment and its gradual transformation in defense posture.</p>

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <img src="images/postwar.jpg" alt="Formation of JSDF">
                    <h4>Post-War Formation (1945-1954)</h4>
                    <p>Following Japan's defeat in World War II, the country was initially demilitarized under Allied occupation. In 1950, with the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S. encouraged Japan to establish a National Police Reserve to maintain domestic security while U.S. forces deployed to Korea.</p>

                    <img src="images/establishment.jpg" alt="Official Establishment">
                    <h4>Official Establishment (1954)</h4>
                    <p>On July 1, 1954, the Japan Self-Defense Forces were formally established under the Self-Defense Forces Law, reorganizing the National Safety Forces into three branches: Ground, Maritime, and Air Self-Defense Forces.</p>
                </div>

                    <h4>Cold War Development (1954-1991)</h4>
                    <p>During the Cold War, the JSDF gradually expanded its capabilities while focusing primarily on defensive operations. Japan's defense budget grew steadily, allowing for modernization of equipment while maintaining the self-defense orientation.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Post-Cold War Transformation</h3>
            <p>After the Cold War ended, Japan began reconsidering its security policies. The Gulf War of 1990-1991 triggered debates about Japan's international security role, as its contribution was limited to financial support rather than personnel.</p>

                    <h4>International Peacekeeping (1992-Present)</h4>
                    <p>The 1992 Peacekeeping Operations Law allowed the JSDF to participate in UN peacekeeping operations for the first time. JSDF personnel have since been deployed to Cambodia, Mozambique, the Golan Heights, Haiti, and South Sudan among other locations.</p>

                    <h4>Domestic Disaster Response</h4>
                    <p>The JSDF has played crucial roles in domestic disaster relief, most notably during the 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake, the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami, and various typhoons and flooding events throughout Japan.</p>

                    <h4>21st Century Evolution</h4>
                    <p>Security legislation passed in 2015 reinterpreted Article 9 to allow the JSDF limited rights to collective self-defense, permitting Japan to defend allies under attack if Japan's survival is threatened. This marked a significant shift in Japan's post-war security policy.</p>
